This is a link to an explanation on how to do a simple api request and how does
	this work:
		https://www.dataquest.io/blog/python-api-tutorial/

** An error in which I run to when doing this tutorial is that I was
	importing the library with '''pip install requests''' but that
	only imports it for python 2, if you get:

		ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'

	try importing the module using '''pip3 install requests'''
